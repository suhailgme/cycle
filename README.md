# Cycle: A memory game made in javascript

### Basic gameplay:
Repeat the sequence of randomly generated highlighted buttons by tapping on each one sequentially. After each successful round, an additional highlighted button will be added to the sequence.  If you do not repeat the sequence correctly, the game will end and restart from the beginning (strict mode) or will allow you to retry the present sequence. 

### From the settings cog:
- Toggle strict mode off (default on) to retry after a failed attempt.
- Toggle sound (default off) to hear piano notes corresponding with each highlighed button.
- Restart is accessible when no animations are occurring.
